# Lithology prediction from well-Logging while drilling-


Lithology prediction is considered an essential requirement in the field of petroleum exploration. 
Since reservoirs consist of complex lithologies, predicting the lithology classes is gradually playing a pivotal role in the geosciences. 
During drilling operations the advancements of real time data recording have been so common in the
petroleum industries in the past and majority of the logging data are recorded in real time process. 
However, sometimes the system encounters data loss or missing values while going through the logging procedures. 
Hence, the application of missing data estimation in automated lithology prediction is so essential. 

In this research Support Vector Machine ( Regressor Model), Deep Neural Network is experimented Xtream Gradient Boosting

After considering a feature selection and feature as optimization method the input parameters were reduced to resistivity, Depth, ILD, Gammar ray(Gr),
